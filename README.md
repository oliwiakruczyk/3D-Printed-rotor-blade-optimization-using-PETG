## Experimental Testing

PETG samples were printed at 30%, 50%, 70% and 100% infill and tested using:

- **ASTM D638** (Tensile test)
- **ASTM D790** (Flexural test)

### Tensile Strength vs. Infill Density

### Flexural Modulus vs. Infill Density

## Design Optimization

A parametric study was performed to determine the optimal infill for safety and weight.

###  Mass vs. Safety Factor for Various Infill Levels
